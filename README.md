## Introduction
In today's digital age, it is essential to have strong and unique passwords for all your online accounts. However, remembering multiple complex passwords can be challenging. KeyVault aims to solve this problem by securely storing your passwords in your local storage, accessible only to you. With this app, you can generate strong passwords, store them, and easily retrieve them when needed.

## Features
- **Secure password storage:** The app utilizes your local storage and adds a security level to access them, ensuring they are protected from unauthorized access.
- **Password generator:** The app provides a built-in password generator that allows you to create strong, unique passwords with custom requirements, such as length, character types, and special symbols.
- **Intuitive user interface:** The user-friendly interface makes it easy to add, edit, and delete passwords, as well as retrieve them whenever required.
- **No data leakage:** The app works completely in offline mod and does not send or receive your data from any servers and reduces the chances of data leakage.

## Installation
To install the Password Manager App, follow these steps:

1. Check the assets section of this repository.
2. Download the installation package for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
4. Once the installation is complete, launch the app.

## Usage
Upon launching the Password Manager App, you will be prompted to create a master password. This master password will be used to access the application and perform other major tasks in the application. Choose a strong, unique password that you can remember, as forgetting it may result in permanent data loss.

Once you have set up your master password, you can begin using the app. Here are some common tasks:

- **Adding a new password:** Click on the "+" button and enter the required information, such as website or application name, website url, password.
- **Generating a password:** To generate a strong password, click on the "Generate Password" or key icon. Specify the desired password length and any other requirements, and the app will generate a random password for you.
- **Editing or deleting a password:** Locate the password you want to modify or remove, and use the provided options to edit or delete it.

## Security
KeyVault prioritizes the security of your data. Here are some key security measures implemented:

- **Master password:** The master password you create during setup is used to access your data. It is crucial to choose a strong, unique password and keep it confidential.
- **Secure storage:** The app ensures that your password database is stored securely on your device.
- **Regular updates:** The development team regularly releases updates to address security vulnerabilities and improve the overall security posture of the app. Make sure to keep your app up to date.

While the KeyVault implements strong security measures, it is important to note that no system is entirely foolproof. It is advisable to follow best practices for your security, such as regularly updating your passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication whenever possible, and being cautious of phishing attempts.
